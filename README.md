# Hydrus-Downloaders

These are downloaders which you can import to Hydrus. There's one at the moment cuz it's really all I wanted to do.

nitter w/ artist - adds an artist tag for nitter.eu URLS (u probably should download the nitter parser from here first tho: https://github.com/CuddleBear92/Hydrus-Presets-and-Scripts/tree/master/Downloaders/Nitter)
